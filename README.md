# React Router v6 Intermittent Routing Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while using React Router DOM v6.  The issue is characterized by inconsistent route rendering.  Routes may fail to display the expected component, instead showing a previous component, or sometimes a blank screen. This behavior is unpredictable and difficult to debug due to its intermittent nature.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.
4. Navigate between the Home, About, and Contact links.  Observe that occasionally, a component will not render correctly.

## Potential Causes

Investigation suggests that this problem might be related to component lifecycle management within React Router or the order in which components are unmounted and remounted when navigating between routes.  The solution explores various strategies to overcome this inconsistency.

## Solution

The solution is provided in `AppSolution.js` and involves using the `useLocation` hook to ensure that the component properly updates when navigation occurs.  This approach ensures the component re-renders with the correct data, resolving the intermittent display issues.
